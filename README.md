# Analysis Process
● Data Overview: Getting the basic sense of the dataset. How many rows and columns,
what are the variables present, are the values categorical or numerical, the total count of
each value, are there missing values, and the data types present in the dataset.

● Univariate Analysis: I looked at individual variables using summary statistics, bar charts,
and histograms to comprehend their distributions and spot anomalies or odd trends.

● Bivariate Analysis: Using comparison plots, I investigated the connections between
certain variables and survival status in order to find connections that were substantially
linked to survival.

● Multivariate Analysis: In order to find intricate patterns that might not be apparent in
more straightforward analyses, I used facet grids, heatmaps, and grouped analyses to
examine interactions between several variables.

● I also created new variables like 'family_size' and 'age_group' to derive additional
insights beyond the raw data.

Statistical/Graphical Technique (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

● Bar charts for categorical values

● Box plots for distribution across variables

● Scatter plot to analyze continuous variables

● Heatmap for correlation checking

● Facet grids for multi-dimensional analysis

# Analysis and Insights
The analysis reveals key trends in Titanic passenger survival, shaped largely by gender, age, class, and port of departure. Only 38.4% of passengers survived, underscoring the tragedy's severity.

Gender was the strongest predictor: 74.2% of women and 59.4% of children under 12 survived, compared to only 18.9% of men, reflecting the "women and children first" policy.

Socioeconomic status also played a major role. Survival rates by class were:

First Class: 62.5%

Second Class: 47.3%

Third Class: 24.2%

These figures suggest that higher-class passengers had better lifeboat access and priority treatment.

Port of departure mattered too. Passengers from Cherbourg had the highest survival rate (55.1%), followed by Queenstown (39.0%) and Southampton (33.7%), aligning with the wealthier demographic of Cherbourg’s passengers.

Overall, survival odds were deeply influenced by age, gender, and especially class, exposing how social inequalities persisted even in a crisis.
